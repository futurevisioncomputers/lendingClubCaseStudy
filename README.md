## General Information
<a id="#general-information">

You work for the LendingClub company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Solving this case study will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.(csv format)
